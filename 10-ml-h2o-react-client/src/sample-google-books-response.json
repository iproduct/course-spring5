Learn to build, grow and test powerful and scalable mobile and desktop web applications with Angular Explore the latest features of Angular 5 and TypeScript 2.4 by building a complete responsive application from scratch. Deliver seamless web navigation experiences with application routing and state handling common features with ease The author has done all the hard work of fitting everything Angular 5 means for developers, making this book the quickest way to learn Angular 5 from scratch. Who This Book Is For This book is for web developers who want to build the next generation of state-of-the-art mobile and desktop web applications with Angular. This book does not require you to have prior exposure to either Angular 1.x, 2 or 4, although comprehensive knowledge of JavaScript is assumed. What You Will Learn Set up the workspace and the project using webpack and Angular-Cli Explore the features of TypeScript and organize the code in ES6 modules Work with HTTP and Data Services and understand how data can flow in the app Create multiple views and learn how to navigate between them Make the app beautiful by adding Material Design Implement two different types of form handling and its validation Add animation to some standard events such as route change, initialization, data load, and so on Discover how to bulletproof your applications by introducing smart unit testing techniques and debugging tools In Detail The latest version of Angular comes with a lot of new features that help you to make your applications smaller and faster. This book will show you how to set up an Angular project, and you'll build Angular components right from the beginning. Moving on, you'll explore and work with the components to build your app. Next, you'll find out more about TypeScript and see how to use it to build apps in the best way possible. You'll then be introduced to the building blocks - Properties, Events, Directives, and Pipes - and how it can be used to implement and enhance the components. Additionally, you'll be using Angular components to organize your components in a scalable way. Then you'll understand how to get data in your app and add navigation to it. Furthermore, you'll deep dive and work with Forms, Authentication, and see how Material design will help you make your app beautiful in just a few short lines of code. Lastly, you'll see how to use animating components with Angular, and test and debug the app. All in all, the overall mission is to give you a great start when developing apps using Angular and TypeScript. Style and approach This book tells you everything there is to know about getting well-acquainted with Angular without bogging you down. Everything is neatly laid out under clear headings for quick consultation, giving you the information required to understand a concept immediately. You'll also get full coverage of the TypeScript syntax required to follow the examples included.",

          "description": "Young stars are surrounded by massive, rotating disks of dust and gas, which supply a reservoir of material that may be incorporated into planets or accreted onto the central star. In this dissertation, I use high angular resolution observations at a range of wavelengths to understand the structure, ubiquity, and evolutionary timescales of protoplanetary disks. First, I describe a study of Class I protostars, objects believed to be at an evolutionary stage between collapsing spherical clouds and fully-assembled young stars surrounded by protoplanetary disks. I use a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code to model new 0.9 micron scattered light images, 1.3 mm continuum images, and broadband spectral energy distributions. This modeling shows that Class I sources are probably surrounded by massive protoplanetary disks embedded in massive infalling envelopes. For the best-fitting models of the circumstellar dust distributions, I determine several important properties, including envelope and disk masses, mass infall rates, and system inclinations, and I use these results to constrain the evolutionary stage of these objects. Second, I discuss observations of the innermost regions of more evolved disks around T Tauri and Herbig Ae/Be stars, obtained with the Palomar Testbed and Keck Interferometers. I constrain the spatial and temperature structure of the circumstellar material at sub-AU radii, and demonstrate that lower-mass stars are surrounded by inclined disks with puffed-up inner edges 0.1-1 AU from the star. In contrast, the truncated inner disks around more massive stars may not puff-up, indicating that disk structure depends on stellar properties. I discuss the implications of these results for disk accretion, terrestrial planet formation and giant planet migration. Finally, I put these detailed studies of disk structure into a broader context by constraining the mass distribution and evolutionary timescales of circumstellar disks. Using the Owens Valley Millimeter Array, I mapped the millimeter continuum emission toward \u003e300 low-mass stars in the NGC 2024 and Orion Nebula clusters. These observations demonstrate that the average disk mass in each cluster is comparable to the \"minimum-mass protosolar nebula,\" and that there may be disk evolution on one million year timescales.",
